## SamuraiInfection
Hey Samurai, some corpo went catatonic in a local braindance den.  His implants were all nonfunctional and it looks like something wiped him, unfortunately he was running some sort of archaic PortholeOS so we can't do anything to recover him.  The halo however survived, looks like it was write protected before use.  We pulled this off of it, see what you can make of it.

Looking at this, the first thought is intended to be DNA.  There are the four bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.  However, this is just a distraction, it is actually base four encoding.  With the groupings it is a safe guess that A == 0.
The groupings are frequently less than 4 chars per byte, so there must be some sort of compression in place.  Let's check if it was just a simple conversion and 0 stripping, first convert each base4 byte into base2, once we have the base2 we can pad it out with leading 0s (that way we don't change the value of the nibble), piece it together to see what we have.

Now we have an executable!!

With an executable the first step is to check for packing, unfortunately tools return an unknown packer.  If you have experience in this area you might notice that the UPX packer flags are mangled, fixing them and unpacking gives you a simple Go binary, otherwise you have to reverse the binary the long way.

Performing analysis on the binary will show two high entropy strings and some XOR operations.  

>82, 51, 100, 95, 72, 51, 114, 114, 49, 110, 103

>0, 122, 48, 12, 13, 112, 9, 59, 92, 30, 11, 18, 93, 16, 106, 23, 115, 0, 65, 110, 8, 18, 60, 108, 39, 23, 120, 3, 63, 15

One of these strings is `R3d_H3rr1ng` so that isn't it.  Running a simple XOR operation does gives us `RITSEC{Impl@nt5_@r3_fun_CH00M}`.  The XOR is technically null preserving but that isn't visible when you are just dealing with the flag, if you try to XOR against encrypted files generated by the program you won't get the flag without performing a null preserving XOR operation.

Flag: RITSEC{Impl@nt5_@r3_fun_CH00M}
